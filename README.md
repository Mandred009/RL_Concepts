<h1 align="center">RL_CONCEPTS</h1>

<p align="center">
  A curated collection of foundational Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and concepts, implemented from scratch in Pytorch with focus on understandability.

The different methods along with their script name is listed below. The theory related to that method can be found in my blog site linked with each method.

Currently there are 9 methods. I will add more methods in the future.
