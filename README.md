This repository contains various reinforcement learning methods implemented using Python and PyTorch.
Every method has been written from scratch and made as digestible as possible.
Some methods may have some points I might have missed, because this repo was created as a way for me to learn, 
implementation of RL from scratch.
Any contribution and details on mistakes would be highly appreciated.

Note: 1) Ignore or delete the mujoco file if you want.
      2) Runs folder is for Tensorboard log files
